inital stack of items: check for minimum support condition increasing order of number of vip items
for prefix {ba}: intersection of b and a and then use the summation

doubts:
line 5: do i need to append i to P and then push it to CP?
line 7: do i need to pop while checking all the items in stack
what is the ordering of initial stack of elements
which is top and which is bottom of stack
line 5 and 12: append i to P twice??
