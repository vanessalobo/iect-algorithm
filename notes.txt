inital stack of items: check for minimum support condition increasing order of number of vip items
for prefix {ba}: intersection of b and a and then use the summation

doubts:
line 5: do i need to append i to P and then push it to CP?
line 7: do i need to pop while checking all the items in stack
what is the ordering of initial stack of elements
which is top and which is bottom of stack
line 5 and 12: append i to P twice??
cr2(ba) is false but it is given as true and cr2(fa) is given false when it actually is less than 0. error in cr2 should be greater than instead of less than???
if sigma=0 divide by zero condition??
